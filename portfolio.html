        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
           Hello! I’m Gayatri, a passionate Frontend Web Developer with a strong interest in 
           creating visually appealing and responsive web interfaces. 
           I completed my Bachelor’s degree from Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) 
           at Padmashri Vikhe Patil College, Loni Pravaranagar,
            and I am currently pursuing my Master’s degree at MIT ACSC, Alandi, Pune.<br>
            <br>

I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, 
and I enjoy building user-friendly, responsive web pages that deliver a 
smooth user experience across devices. Along with frontend development,
 I have basic knowledge of Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. 
 I am also actively enhancing my skills in UI/UX design,
  aiming to combine aesthetics with usability to create meaningful digital experiences.
   I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my craft as a web developer.
